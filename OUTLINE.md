## Outline

- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides ready to use widgets to help you build great apps without writing a lot of code.
- I'd like to show how you can build an impactful app with only a few widgets
- Reference page for the Popup widget
  - Popup lets you view content about a feature
  - Automatically setup on a view
  - Just like all our widgets, its easy to customize using settings
- Lets look at an example
  - Here's a simple app using a webmap in New York area
  - Map has 10 layers
  - each layer shows a count of home values in a defined range
  - Top right: Legend widget
    - useful to display symbology for the layers on the map
  - click feature
  - explain custom action
  - Next release of API: FeatureTable in Beta
    - view attributes for features on a layer using a data table
    - Loads data dynamically
    - Sort data
  - You can test out now using CDN '/next' version Julie mentioned
- Lets see src
- Swipe widget on the API documentation. New since last DS
  - lets you compare the differences between two or more layers by clipping horizontally or vertically.
- swipe widget demo
  - continuous scrolling to compare a set of layers
  - Less cluttered and easier to see patterns
- Additional benefits of these widgets
  - Internationalized in 30+ languages
  - Developed to be accessible to keyboard & screen reader users
  - Code for the view and sass is open source on Github for customization
  - reference guide for theming
  - Tooling available on Esri's Github.
- We hope these widgets will make it easier to create awesome apps!
- Thank you
