- Thanks Euen
- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides ready to use widgets, to help you build great apps without writing a lot of code.
- I'd like to show how you can build an impactful app, using only a few.
- Heres the reference page Popup
  - Popup is automatically setup on a view and gives you info about a feature
  - Just like all widgets, easy to customize via settings
  - By default, a zoom to action is on the Popup, but as a developer I can add custom actions
- Lets look at an example app
  - Here's a webmap of the New York area containing 10 layers
  - each layer shows info about home values in a defined price range
  - I've also added a Legend in the top right to display symbology for the layers
  - [CLICK FEATURE]: get information about it
  - Zoom to it using the default action
  - Here I added custom action to open a data table
  - Next release of JSAPI: adding FeatureTable widget
    - FeatureTable view rows of attributes for features in a layer
    - As I scroll table, data loaded dynamically
    - Sort data using column headers
  - You can try out the FeatureTable right now using the /NEXT version JEREMY mentioned
- Lets see source for this demo
- since last DS, we've also added a Swipe widget
  - Here's a SDK sample using Swipe.
  - By swiping, layers are partially displayed which is great for comparing data.
- Building on demo I showed, I've added a multiple Swipe setup.
  - Each layer now has it's own swipe, that moves as the page is scrolled.
  - As I move up and down, I can compare layers and see patterns
- JSAPI widgets are also highly customizable
  - They use the view viewModel pattern so that logic and presentation are kept separated.
  - We've made the view and styles open source on GitHub
  - So you can theme widgets, tweak a widget's design or add functionality
- Additional benefits of these widgets
  - Internationalized in 30+ languages
  - and Developed to be to keyboard & screen-reader accessible
- We hope these widgets will make it easier to create awesome apps!
