## Outline

- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides ready to use widgets to help you build great apps without writing a lot of code.
- I'd like to show how you can build an impactful app using only a few widgets
- Reference page for the Popup widget
  - Automatically setup on a view
  - Popup lets you view content about a feature
  - Just like all our widgets, its easy to customize using settings
  - custom action explain
- Lets look at an example
  - Here's a map of the New York area
  - Using webmap with 10 layers
  - each layer shows info about home values in a defined price range
  - Top right: Legend widget
    - useful to display symbology for the layers on the map
  - CLICK FEATURE
  - explain custom action
  - Next release of API: FeatureTable Beta widget
    - Data table to view attributes all features on a layer
    - Scroll to load data dynamically
    - Ability to sort data clicking header
  - You can test out now using CDN /NEXT version Julie mentioned
- Lets see src
- Swipe widget on the API documentation. New since last DS
  - lets you compare the differences between two or more layers by clipping horizontally or vertically.
- swipe widget demo
  - continuous scrolling to compare a set of layers
  - Less cluttered and easier to see patterns
- Additional benefits of these widgets
  - Internationalized in 30+ languages
  - Developed to be accessible to keyboard & screen reader users
  - Code for the widget is open source on Github for customization
  - Links to tooling for theming & styling widgets
- We hope these widgets will make it easier to create awesome apps!
- Thank you
