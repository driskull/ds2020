# Outline

- Thanks Euen
- The ArcGIS JSAPI provides ready to use widgets, to help you build great apps without writing a lot of code
- I'd like to show how you can build an impactful app using a few of them
- Heres the reference page for Popup
  - Popup gives you info about a feature, is automatically setup on a view
  - Just like all widgets, easy to customize through settings
  - By default, a zoom-to action is available, but as a developer I can add custom actions next to it
- Lets look at an example app i've created
  - Here's a webmap of the New York area containing 10 layers
  - each layer shows info about home values in a defined price range
  - I've added a Legend in the top right to display symbology for each layer
  - [CLICK FEATURE]: get popup info about it
  - Zoom-to it using the default action
  - Here I've added custom action to open a data-table
  - Next release of JSAPI: adding FeatureTable widget
    - FeatureTable lets u view rows of attributes, for features in a layer
    - As I scroll the table, data loaded dynamically
    - I can also sort data using a column header
  - You can try out the FeatureTable right now using the [/NEXT] release JEREMY mentioned a few minutes ago
- Lets see source for this demo
- since last DS, we've also added a Swipe widget
  - Here's a SDK sample using Swipe.
  - By swiping, layers are partially displayed which is great for comparing data.
- Building on demo I just showed
  - I've added multiple Swipes to it
  - Each layer now has it's own swipe, that moves as the page is scrolled.
  - As I move up and down, I can compare layers and see patterns
- JSAPI widgets are also highly customizable
  - By using a view viewModel pattern, logic and presentation are separated.
  - We've made the view and styles open source on GitHub
  - So you can tweak a widget's design or add functionality
- Additional benefits of these widgets
  - Easily themable using tooling on Github
  - Internationalized in nearly 40 languages
  - and Developed to be to keyboard & screen-reader accessible
- We hope these widgets will make it easier to create awesome apps!
