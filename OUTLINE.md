- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides over 40 ready to use widgets.
  - These widgets can help you build great apps without writing a lot of code.
  - Allows you more time to focus on the core functionality of your app.
- Show how using a few widgets can build an impactful app.
- Popup widget on the API documentation.
  - view content about a feature
  - Setup for you in a view
  - customizable through settings
- Legend widget on API
  - nice thing: widgets are highly customizable with settings and options

  - Here's a simple app with a map and the legend widget
  - webmap description
  - click feature
  - explain custom action
  - FeatureTable
    - view attributes for features on a layer in a data table

- Swipe widget continuous scroll sample
- swipe widget demo scroll
  - continuous scrolling to compare a set of layers
- Additional benefits of these widgets
  - Internationalized in 30+ languages
  - Code for the view and sass is open source on Github
  - Themable by using the tooling on JSAPI resources on github
- We hope these will allow you to easily create great apps! thank you
