- Wait for FeatureTable PR and installed in /next
- Simplify code as possible

* tab showing widget in sdk before each app.
* mention in `next` API version you can try out today.

question: next release sdk info? how do users test without doc?

Run through demo 24 times at least.

- Have paper with keywords on it.

notes

- dont say clicking on links
- don't repeat widget so much its assumed after showing widget
- popup and legend widget (practice)
- bigger font
- drag src code
- elaborate on widget view (customizing)
- elaborate on sass theming and slower scrolling (page down or arrowkeys)
- tweak to sass experience
- explain custom action better
- no showing SDK for FeatureTable
- less repeating
