## Outline

- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides ready to use widgets to help you build great apps without writing a lot of code.
- I'd like to show how you can build an impactful app using only a few widgets.
- SDK page showing the Popup widget
  - Popup lets you view content about a feature
  - Automaticly setup for you on a view
  - Just like all our widgets, its easy to customize using settings
- Lets look at at an example
  - Here's a simple app using a webmap
  - new york area
  - 10 layers, each counting home values in a defined range
  - Top right: Legend widget
    - useful to display symbology for the layers within the map
  - click feature
  - explain custom action
  - Next release of API: FeatureTable in Beta
    - view attributes for features on a layer using a data table
    - Loads data dynamically
    - Sort data
  - You can test out now using CDN '/next' version Julie mentioned
- Lets see src
- Swipe widget on the API documentation. New since last DS
  - lets you compare the differences between two or more layers by clipping horizontally or vertically.
- swipe widget demo
  - continuous scrolling to compare a set of layers
- Additional benefits of these widgets
  - Developed to be accessible for keyboard & screen reader navigation
  - Internationalized in 30+ languages
  - Code for the view and sass is open source on Github
  - Themable by using the tooling available on JSAPI resources project on Esri's github.
- We hope these widgets will make it easier to create awesome apps!
- Thank you
