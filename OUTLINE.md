## Outline

- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides ready to use widgets to help you build great apps without writing a lot of code.
- I'd like to show how using just a few widgets can impactful app.
- Start Popup widget on SDK
  - view content about a feature
  - Setup for you on a view
  - Just like all our widgets easily customized through settings
- Lets look at a simple app with a few widgets.
  - Here's a simple app using the legend widget
  - Legend widget useful to display information about the map or specific layers
  - DESCRIBE WEBMAP
  - click feature
  - explain custom action
  - Next release of API: FeatureTable
    - view attributes for features on a layer using a data table
    - Loads data dynamically
    - Sort data
  - You can test out now using CDN /next instead of the version number
- Lets see src
- Swipe widget on the API documentation. New since last year
  - lets you compare the differences between two or more layers by clipping horizontally or vertically.
- swipe widget demo
  - continuous scrolling to compare a set of layers
- Additional benefits of these widgets
  - Developed to be accessible for keyboard and screen reader users
  - Internationalized in 30+ languages
  - Code for the view and sass is open source on Github
  - Themable by using the tooling available on JSAPI resources project on Esri's github.
- We hope these widgets will make it easier for you to create great apps!
- Thank you
