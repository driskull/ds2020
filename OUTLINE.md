- The ArcGIS API For JS provides ready to use widgets, to help you build great apps with less code
- I'd like to show how you can build an impactful app using just a few of them
- **Heres the reference page for Popup**
  - Popup gives you info about a feature, is automatically setup on a view
  - Just like all widgets, easy to customize by setting props
  - By default, a zoom-to action is there, but as a developer I can add custom actions next to it
- **Lets look at an example app i've created**
  - Here's a webmap of the New York area containing 10 layers
  - each layer shows info about home values in a defined price range
  - I've added a Legend in the top right to display symbology for each layer
  - [CLICK FEATURE]: see popup info about it
  - I can zoom in closer, using the zoom-to action
  - I've also added a custom action to open a data-table
  - Next release of JSAPI: adding FeatureTable widget
    - FeatureTable lets u view rows of attributes, for features in a layer
    - As I scroll the table, additional data loaded dynamically
    - I can also sort data using a column header
  - You can try out the FeatureTable right now using the /NEXT] release JEREMY mentioned a few minutes ago
- **Lets see source for this demo**
- **since last DS, we've also added a Swipe widget**
  - Here's an SDK sample using Swipe.
  - By swiping, layers are partially displayed which is great for comparing data.
- **Building on demo I just showed**
  - I've enhanced and added multiple Swipes
  - Each layer now has it's own swipe, that moves as the page is scrolled.
  - As I move up and down, I can compare layers and see patterns
- **JSAPI widgets are also highly customizable**
  - They use a view viewModel pattern, so logic is separated from presentation.
  - We've made the view and its styles open source on GitHub
  - So you can tweak a widget's design, or add functionality
- **Additional benefits of these widgets**
  - Internationalized in nearly 40 languages
  - and Developed to be to keyboard & screen-reader accessible
- We hope these widgets will make it easier for you to create awesome apps!
