## Outline

- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides over 40 ready to use widgets.
  - These widgets help you build great apps without writing a lot of code.
- I'd like to show how using just a few widgets impactful app.
- Start Popup widget on API reference page
  - view content about a feature
  - Setup for you on a view
  - Just like all our widgets easily customized through settings
