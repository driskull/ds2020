## Outline

- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides over 40 ready to use widgets.
  - These widgets help you build great apps without writing a lot of code.
- I'd like to show how using just a few widgets impactful app.
- Start Popup widget on SDK
  - view content about a feature
  - Setup for you on a view
  - Just like all our widgets customized through settings
- Another helpful widget: Legend widget
  - configure legend to only a single layer or all layers in map
- Lets look at a demo customizing the popup
  - Here's a simple app using the legend widget
  - webmap description
  - click feature
  - explain custom action
  - Next release of API: FeatureTable
    - view attributes for features on a layer using a data table
  - You can test out now using CDN/next
- Lets see src
- Lets look at the Swipe widget on the API documentation.
  - lets you compare the differences between two or more layers by clipping horizontally or vertically.
- Swipe widget continuous scroll sample
- swipe widget demo scroll
  - continuous scrolling to compare a set of layers
- Additional benefits of these widgets
  - Internationalized in 30+ languages
  - Code for the view and sass is open source on Github
  - Themable by using the tooling on JSAPI resources on github
- We hope these widgets will make it easier for you to create great apps!
- Thank you
