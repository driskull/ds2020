## Script

- The ArcGIS JavaScript API provides ready to use widgets to help you build your apps.
- These widgets are accessible to users with disabilities and they text strings used are internationalized into over 30 languages
- When developing the widgets, we focused on allowing API users to customize and configure the widgets to fit their apps needs.
- With very little code, a user can configure a widget to do what they need or customize the look and feel to match their brand or map.
- Lets look at an app using a few of our widgets.
- This application uses the Swipe widget setup to work as an infinite scroll and change the layer while a user scrolls.
- It's also using a slider widget to control the time data displayed in the maps view.
- I'm using a button which i've positeiond in the top right corner to toggle the upcoming FeatureTable widget which displays information about features displayed within the map.
...
- Lastly, I'd like to show you how you can further customize widgets.
- Our widgets presentation view as well as styles are available for download on our SDK.
- Our SDK links out to the source code available on GitHub.
- We hope these widgets will save you lots of development time building your mapping applications.
- Thank you!
