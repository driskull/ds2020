Figure out your key messages (what you want people to get out of your 5 minutes). Write them out. Then you design your app to directly support that, and nothing more or less. That saves you time -- don't waste time building something cool or offtrack if it (in the end) will be changed or not used

every click in your demo is purpose-driven - to support those key messages in some way

Thinking about demo...

Tornado demo could have a swipe/time capability and show a FeatureTable to show additional information about the data.


Run through demo 24 times at least.
- Have paper with keywords on it.
